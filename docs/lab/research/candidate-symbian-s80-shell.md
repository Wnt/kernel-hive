# Nokia 9300 shell detail — EikSrv, application keys, the SDK-emulator oracle

Sibling of [`candidate-symbian-s80.md`](candidate-symbian-s80.md) §H7. Holds
the mechanism-by-mechanism detail, the wall evidence and the SDK-emulator
trace facts that would otherwise bloat the main document. Facts only, from
agents B1 and X1's reports (2026-09-24); nothing here is disassembly or a ROM
byte dump — mechanisms and traces only, per the repo's abandonware rules.

## The mechanisms (agent B1, fork branch `s80-shell` @ `19308cbd0`)

Who owns the buttons on the real device: the Eikon server's UI library
`EikSrvUi.dll` ("EikAppKey" active object) captures the application buttons'
key ups and downs (`RWindowGroup::CaptureKeyUpAndDowns` is in its import
list) and launches or foregrounds the bound app; `SysAp.app` holds Desk and
"My own" the same way. Before this wave, EKA2L1 replaced the Eikon server
with the HLE `eikappui_server` ("EikAppUiServer"), which owned no keys, and
`SysAp` never ran under `--run` — so nobody on the emulator received the
buttons at all.

| # | Mechanism | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| ii | **HLE in the window server** — `window_server::s80_handle_app_key()` (`window.cpp`): on an S80 device scancodes 0xB4–0xBB are swallowed (the focused app never sees them, as on the device); a key-down schedules `WsS80AppKeyEvent` on the emulator's timer thread → `switch_to_app(uid)`: the app's topmost window group goes to ordinal position 0 and takes focus if it is running, else the app-list server launches it. Table: Desk `0x101F8E4F`, Telephone `0x101F4D0B`, Messaging `0x100053B3`, Web `0x101F4DE8`, Contacts `0x100007ED` (Cmgr), Documents `0x10003A64`, Calendar `0x10003A5C`, My own `0x100007BA` (File manager, the factory default in `SharedData` `101f8e64.ini`). The HLE steps aside as soon as any guest holds a `CaptureKey`/`CaptureKeyUpAndDowns` on that key, so a ROM Eikon server takes the buttons over with no code change. `switch_to_app()` is public, for a future host control channel. | **KEPT — proven** | it is the device's behaviour minus the ROM code that implements it |
| — | **Captured keys were never delivered**: `io.cpp:198` looked up `key_capture_requests[evt.key_evt_.code]`, and the raw event's code is always 0. Rewritten so a `CaptureKey` request (keyed by translated key code) wins the translated key event and a `CaptureKeyUpAndDowns` request (keyed by scan code) wins the up/down events; winner = highest signed priority whose modifier mask matches, newest on a tie; the winner gets the event **instead of** the focus (nonnga wserv `EVENT.CPP` semantics). Requests are dropped on `CancelCaptureKey*` and in `~window_group`. Written independently, the same shape as EKA2L1-WEB's `dc3344530` key-capture rewrite (see the main doc's §Prior work found). | **KEPT** | prerequisite for the ROM EikSrv ever owning the keys; also fixes S60 CaptureKey users |
| — | Session ops that parked a server forever: `ClearHotKeys` (→ `KErrNone`), `Start/CompleteCustomTextCursor` (→ `KErrNotSupported`), `SetSystemPointerCursor`, `Claim/FreeSystemPointerCursorList`, `Set/ClearDefaultSystemPointerCursor` (→ `KErrNone`). | **KEPT** | the ROM Eikon server issues all of them while constructing (log showed `Unimplemented ClOp: 0x31/0x2f/0x48`) |
| — | chimera-core 0030 (see the main doc's prior-work sweep): a window group remembers its owner process by kernel id and checks it is alive before touching the pointer. | **KEPT** | an app launched from Desk or the buttons outlives its starter |
| i | **Run the ROM's real Eikon server**: `EKA2L1_ROM_EIKSRV=1` skips the HLE EikAppUiServer, Notifier and ViewServer; Desk's connect then summons `eiksrvs.exe`, which creates `EikAppUiServer`, `ViewServer`, `AlarmServer`, `AlarmAlertServer`. **Desk stays black behind it** — the guest area never paints; the Eikon server thread keeps getting IPC completions, but Desk's first window never draws. | **OPEN, fidelity thread** | it would give the six generic buttons, the Menu-hold task list and the status pane from ROM code; needs a per-thread wait table (see "Method notes" below) to name what Desk's thread is waiting on |
| i' | Start `Starter.exe` / `SysAp` with a trimmed start list | **DROPPED for now** | Starter, SysAp and `Startup.app` all reach the DOS server (phone link); needs an HLE DOS server first. `Startup.app` alone runs (`--run 0x10000865`): the "Current city" wizard page paints with a black list, then it launches `desk.app` through the ROM's own apparc path ("Trying to summon: APPRUN.EXE") |
| iii | Desk launching apps itself / the empty Desk pane | **not B1's** | Desk paints its buttons but never its main pane in any C: state tried: a fresh C:, the SDK emulator's `Shortcuts.dat`+`desk.ini`, `Desk state=0`. With the file server traced, Desk opens `skinerin.rsc`, the `s80*` resources and `desk.aif`, creates `Shortcuts.dat` and `101f8e4f.ini`, and never opens `desk_content.rsc` — C: state is not the cause. Owned by agent B6 (AppList server op 0). |

## Walls left standing (not B1's)

1. **A third `apprun` never finishes constructing its UI** — reproduced with
   no HLE at all: `--run Desk --run Documents --run Web` gives three unnamed
   window groups and a black guest area. Desk + any one app always works;
   the third app launched at any time is the victim, regardless of which app
   it is. IPC trace: the third process loads its libraries like the second,
   creates its chunks, connects `EikAppUiServer`, `FileServer`,
   `Fontbitmapserver`, `Windowserver` ("Create screen device"), connects the
   ROM's `SkinServer` twice, gets four completions ("thread to signal:
   cword") and then issues nothing more — no request follows the second skin
   connect, no panic, no exit. The second process sends "3 / 18 sync to
   SkinServer" right after connecting. Owned by agent B4 (has both the
   server side and the third-client resource side). This wall blocks "Desk →
   Documents → Desk → Web with every app alive" as one session; today it is
   Desk plus one app at a time, or Desk plus two if the third is never
   started.
2. **Empty Desk pane** — owned by agent B6, see mechanism iii above.
3. **ROM Eikon server + black Desk** — parked, see mechanism i above.

## Commits on `fork/s80-shell` (all small, cherry-pickable)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `3aa70e9eb` | wserv: Series 80 application buttons switch apps; route captured keys to their capturer (+ `ClearHotKeys` / custom text cursor completions, `EKA2L1_ROM_EIKSRV` switch) |
| `1e92fc0c5` | wserv: a window group may outlive the process that started its owner (port of chimera 0030) |
| `19308cbd0` | wserv: answer the system pointer-cursor session ops so a ROM Eikon server can construct |

Stashed, not pushed: chimera 0021 (EKA1 `bus_dev_open_socket` creates a real
LDD channel) + 0022 (null LDD accepting every request) — they change
`ldd/CMakeLists.txt` (a reconfigure) and matter for the Starter/SysAp path
(mechanism i'), not the buttons; whoever picks that up should take them from
the prior-work sweep's chimera patches directly.

## Method notes (so a resumer does not repeat the same traps)

- Kill only PIDs recorded in your own pid files, resolved through
  `/proc/<pid>/exe` — never a cmdline grep or `pkill -f` (rule 5). After a
  relink, `/proc/<pid>/exe` of a running emulator reads
  `.../bin/.mold-XXXX (deleted)`, not `eka2l1_qt`; a kill script matching the
  exe name by string can silently miss it and leave a ghost emulator
  contaminating the next frame set.
- `grep` skips non-UTF-8 logs as binary by default; an empty result on
  `EKA2L1.log` can be wrong — use `grep -a`.
- `--listapp` prints nothing on this build; app UIDs come from the `.app`
  header (`uid3`) and the log, not the CLI.
- A `CMakeLists.txt` touch (even by a stash) re-runs `cmake` and re-clones
  `libuv` from GitHub unless the configure step is overridden.
- Wait for frame changes with a polling `fbwait`-style script (2 Hz,
  compared against the previous frame or a supplied reference), never a
  fixed sleep — a fast app switch is otherwise missed.

## The SDK emulator as a dynamic oracle (agent X1)

Nokia's own Series 80 DP2.0 SDK emulator (`epoc.exe` udeb, Symbian OS 7.0s
build 04423365) runs unmodified on Windows 11 in a `win11` rig clone, boots
the real Series 80 shell to Desk, and runs Documents and Opera. Under
x32dbg, every `RSessionBase::DoSendReceive` and `CreateSession` call is
logged with server name, opcode, the four IPC arguments and the calling DLL
— a dynamic oracle for exactly the facts static disassembly would otherwise
have to supply. Traces are saved as `a-boot.txt` (boot to Desk) and
`b-appkeys.txt` (the application-key press) in the job's `X1/traces/`
directory; they are IPC call logs, not disassembly.

**Rig.** A clone of the live `win11` station (`rig-clone.sh`), qemu-guest-agent
as the driver (a scheduled task with a `BUILTIN\Users` group principal runs
GUI programs in the interactive console session with no keyboard typing of
Win+R needed), the unshield-extracted SDK `Epoc32/` tree copied in as a zip
and untarred to the SDK's documented path (no installer run: `EUSER.DLL`
derives its root from its own path). `epoc.ini` carries the fascia geometry
(640×200 screen, `VirtualKey EstdKeyApplication0-7`/`EstdKeyDevice0-3` click
rects) — the same reference the team's key model already used. `x32dbg`'s
own quirks (a first-run dialog, `SetBreakpointFastResume` resuming before a
log line is written, a locked trace-log file) were worked around with a
pushed-in `.ini`, `guiupdatedisable`, and periodic VSS snapshots of the log
file (`esentutl /y … /vss`) since QGA holds the log open exclusively.

**Real boot creates roughly three dozen servers (X1 counted 36) in this
order:** FileServer, Loader, Fontbitmapserver, Windowserver,
SharedDataServer, DosServer, FLogger, EikAppUiServer, SkinServer,
EtelServer, Comsdbg, RootServer, SimuServer/SimuData, ViewServer,
BackupServer, AlarmAlertServer, ecomserver, `!Notifier`, SystemAgent,
ShutdownServer, LogServ, AppListServer 5.1.117, MsvServer, AlarmServer,
SocketServer, DBMS, DatabaseLockServer, WAPServer, ClkNitzMdlServer,
CommServer, BTManServer, Sdp. Starter's own start-list resource
(`STARTER.RSC`/`STARTER_SHELL.RSC`) gives the item *type* codes: 5 = splash,
1 = exe, 22 = Eikon server (`HandleStartEikon`), 7 = app. The startup
reason for a normal boot is `100`, with `SysState` `201`
(`ESWStateInitialising`).

**How an application key is actually handled** (confirms B1's HLE model,
mechanism ii above, from an independent live oracle): the Eikon server's own
thread calls the AppList server's op 5 with the pressed app's UID, then op 7;
the new app's thread then opens its own `EikAppUiServer` session. Frame
evidence: the Documents button paints Documents' editor in the SDK emulator
(CBA "Insert object / Font / Style / Exit"); the Desk button from inside
Documents returns to Desk in about a second (a "back-stepping chain reset");
holding a CBA key 1.5 s opens the task list ("Document / MessageRelayApp
application / PegAgent") — the long-press-Menu behaviour EKA2L1 still has to
implement (`CaptureLongKey`, above); Left Alt is the device's Chr key
(Alt+a/e/o/u → accented letters), and holding Chr alone for 1.5 s opens an
"Insert character" table.

**Why X1 could not get a post-`Start` Opera network trace.** The SDK
emulator's Ethernet needs Nokia's own 2004-era unsigned 32-bit NDIS driver
chain (not WinPcap), which cannot load on a Windows 11 x64 guest; Windows
Firewall prompts once for the emulator's own listening socket
(Starter/PegAgent or the WINS Ethernet ESock layer) and dismissing it changes
nothing. Opera's own connection attempt in the SDK emulator shows the real
device's dialog EKA2L1 never draws: "Network connection — Select an access
point" (Network / GSM Data / Easy WLAN), "Connecting…" for about 19 s, then a
silent failure and a re-prompt, with no error dialog — because the emulator
VM has no packet driver. A Windows XP rig, which can still load the old NDIS
chain, would be needed to get a real post-`Start` Opera trace from this
oracle.
